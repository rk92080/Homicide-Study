# Homicide-Study
# Causes Behind Homicides 


For this project I wanted to tackle the problem of the [United States elevated Homicide Rate](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1374211/g7-country-homicide-rate/) compared to other highly developed nations. Much of the consideration around this topic resolves around Poverty, Gun Ownership, and Mental Health. Specifically, I wanted to look at the these different metrics at a county level using Census and CDC datasources; Over 3 Jupyter Notebooks I take my raw data and perform the proper cleaning and data modfication required before moving to EDA and finally Model Creation. I hope you find this project informative and interesting.
